# Stats and Systems: Village Edition

This is a Python-based simulation project that creates a virtual village where all actions and events are governed by statistical probabilities. In this simulated world, players can observe and interact with a community of villagers, but the village will thrive or decline based on the statistical dynamics regardless of player intervention. Players act as additional variables in the equation, influencing the village's trajectory but not solely determining its fate.

## Key Features

1. **Statistical Modeling:** Every aspect of the village, from childbirth to foraging, is driven by statistical probabilities. Each villager has unique statistics governing their abilities and behaviors.

2. **Dynamic Simulation:** The village evolves over time as villagers age, reproduce, and interact with their environment. Random events and encounters add unpredictability and excitement to the simulation.

3. **Resource Management:** Players can influence the village's resource allocation, but the village's survival and growth are ultimately determined by its statistical dynamics.

4. **Player Influence:** Players act as additional variables in the simulation, influencing the village's development through strategic decisions and interventions.

5. **Exploration and Discovery:** As the simulation progresses, players uncover new elements of the village's ecosystem, encountering wildlife, discovering new resources, and influencing the village's statistical dynamics.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to explore the interconnectedness of various factors within an ecosystem and how changes in one aspect can cascade throughout the entire system. By observing and interacting with the virtual village, players gain insights into the delicate balance of ecosystems and the complex relationships between different elements. Through experimentation and observation, players can learn how to adapt and manage these interconnected systems to promote sustainability and resilience within the village.
