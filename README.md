## Predator-Prey Simulation Branch

This branch of the project implements a predator-prey simulation within the existing village simulation framework. It simulates the dynamics of predator-prey interaction.

### Goal

The goal is to simulate predator-prey dynamics that will have similar results as the Lotka-Volterra equations, without explicitly using them.

## To-Do List

1. **Define Parameters**
   - [ ] Define parameters for prey and predator agents:
     - Birth rate
     - Death rate
     - Reproductive rate
     - Maximum population size
     - Energy requirements
     - Success rates for hunting or fleeing

2. **Agent-Based Modeling**
   - [ ] Implement an agent-based modeling approach:
     - Define classes for prey and predator agents
     - Assign initial characteristics and behaviors to each agent

3. **Simulation Steps**
   - [ ] Implement simulation steps:
     - Update the state of each agent in each time step
     - Handle reproduction, mortality, and interactions between agents

4. **Interaction Rules**
   - [ ] Define rules for how prey and predator agents interact:
     - Prey agents flee from nearby predators
     - Predator agents hunt nearby prey

5. **Population Dynamics**
   - [ ] Track population sizes of prey and predator agents:
     - Visualize population dynamics over time
     - Generate graphs to observe ecosystem behavior

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - [ ] Introduce feedback mechanisms:
     - Implement density-dependent birth and death rates
     - Model how population sizes affect reproduction and mortality rates

7. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - [ ] Conduct sensitivity analysis:
     - Explore how changes in model parameters affect ecosystem dynamics
     - Identify key factors driving population fluctuations
